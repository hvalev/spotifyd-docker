Spotifyd within a docker container for ARM (armv7/arm64) and x32/x64 architectures in configuration variants alsa/pulseaudio for audio-backend and with/without D-Bus API for controlling spotifyd through generic media players.

## Insights
According to my subjective experience and available hardware, dbus in the alsa variant is better as it uses a software controller which appears to increase volume linearly. On the other hand the volume control with pure alsa renders anything below 60% practically unhearable and anything above 80% too loud. I haven't tested the pulseaudio version yet. Let me know if you have some feedback.

## How to run the alsa variant
```bash
docker run -d --net host --group-add $(getent group audio | cut -d: -f3) --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd -v /usr/share/alsa:/usr/share/alsa -v $PWD/contrib/spotifyd.conf:/etc/spotifyd.conf hvalev/spotifyd-XXX
```
where you need to replace ```XXX``` with the appropriate image tag in ```https://hub.docker.com/u/hvalev```.
or with docker-compose:
```yaml
services:
  spotifyd:
    container_name: spotify
    restart: always
    image: hvalev/spotifyd-XXX
    network_mode: host
    devices:
      - /dev/snd:/dev/snd
    volumes:
      - /usr/share/alsa:/usr/share/alsa
      - /etc/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf:/etc/spotifyd.conf
      - /etc/asound.conf:/etc/asound.conf
    group_add:
      - ${AUDIO_GRP}
```

If you're running this on a raspberry-pi, you can replace ${AUDIO_GRP} with 29 as that is the id of the audiogroup user. If not, simply type ```id``` in the terminal and enter whatever number shows next to (audio).

## How to run the pulseaudio variant
```yaml
services:
  spotify:
    container_name: spotify
    restart: always
    image: hvalev/spotifyd-pulseaudio
    user: ${PUID}:${PGID}
    #network_mode: host #disabling to only show logged in user in spotify app (if you run multiple containers at once with different user logins)
    devices:
      - /dev/snd:/dev/snd
    group_add:
      - ${AUDIO_GRP}
    environment: 
      - PULSE_SERVER=unix:/tmp/pulseaudio.socket
      - PULSE_COOKIE=/tmp/pulseaudio.cookie
    volumes:
      - /run/user/1000/pulse/native:/tmp/pulseaudio.socket
      - ${USERDIR}/docker/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf:/etc/spotifyd.conf
```

## How to build it
Grab the dockerfile with the configuration you wish to build and remove ```--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM``` from the first image.

## Information
At the moment the rust-fix intermediary build image exists as a workaround to this [bug](https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/395).

## Limitations
Spotifyd requires a Spotify Premium account.
